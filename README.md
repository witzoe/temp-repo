My major is Smart City Convergence, and I have used GitHub several times in my major courses, including the course on Geographic Information Systems.
Through open-source classes, I was able to gain a more concrete understanding of GitHub-related topics.
Additionally, I found that being able to leave a brief introduction in my personal repository is similar to social networking sites.
